    <p>Exceptions:  an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error.</p>
    <p>Stack Traces: a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred</p>
    <p>Warnings: A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. This means the program will continue to run after a warning.</p>
    <p>Strict Mode:  produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features.</p>

    <p>Linting Tools: Linting tools such asJS Lint,JS Hint,andES Lintcan be used to test the quality of JavaScript code, beyond simply using strict mode. They are designed to highlight any sloppy programming practices or syntax errors, and will complain if certain style conventions are not followed, such as how code is indented</p>
    <p>Feature Detection: The recommended way to determine browser support for a feature is to use feature detection. This is done using an if statement to check whether an object or method exists before trying to actually call the method.</p>

    <p>Trowing an Exception: It’s also possible to throw your own exceptions using the throw statement. This will allow for any problems in your code to be highlighted and dealt with, rather than lurk quietly in the background.
        The throw statement can be applied to any JavaScript expression, causing the execution of the program to stop</p>
    <p>Exception Handeling: It is possible to handle exceptions gracefully by catching the error. Any errors can be hidden from users, but still identified. We can then deal with the error appropriately ― perhaps even ignore it ― and keep the program running.</p>
